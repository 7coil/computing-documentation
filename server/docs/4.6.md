## 4.6.4 - Logic Gates

De Morgan's law is by De Morgan. De Morgan thought to himself:

_Hmm, I can break the line and change the sign!_

At that moment, this method of boolean algebra was uncovered, allowing simplification of complicated things to be possibru.

### NOT Gate

\\(\\neg a\\)

A | Q
- | -
0 | 1
1 | 0

### AND Gate

\\(a \\cap b = q\\)

A | B | Q
- | - | -
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 1

### OR Gate

\\(a \\cup b = q\\)

A | B | Q
- | - | -
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 1

### XOR Gate

\\(a \\oplus b = q\\)

A | B | Q
- | - | -
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 0

### NAND Gate

A | B | Q
- | - | -
0 | 0 | 1
